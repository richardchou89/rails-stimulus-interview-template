# Rails and Stimulus Interview Template

You've landed an interview for a Rails developer role. Just three hours before the big moment, you get an email: you're expected to pair program using a Rails + Stimulus setup.

Suddenly, you're scrambling - installing Rails, Stimulus, and all the necessary gems - only to run into integration issues.

Skip the stress. This template comes pre-configured with Rails and Stimulus, so you can focus on what really matters: preparing for the interview.

Use it in your code challenge, pair programming, or next SaaS idea.
